 * Broker-side event telemetry: one JSON line per broker lifecycle event, appended

 * telemetry file. The broker is a SECOND writer, so it deliberately lives in its
 * own file rather than sharing the turn file (which documents an unlocked roll
 * race that a second concurrent writer would worsen).
 *
 * This is the first companion-side source for REAL broker restart counts: the
 * broker self-heal (generation bump + child swap) is otherwise invisible to the
 * companion, which until now could only INFER restarts from the `interrupted`
 * turn bucket. With these events the status report can show actual broker
 * churn (recovery-succeeded / recovery-failed) instead of an inference.
 *
 * Record shape: `{ at, event }` where event is one of
 *   recovery-started | recovery-succeeded | recovery-failed | child-spawned
 * plus `generation` and `reason` when the caller knows them.
 *
 * Same best-effort/never-throw discipline as the turn file: every write reuses
 * the shared appendTelemetryLine helper (append + single-generation roll at the
 * same byte cap), and reads tolerate torn/partial lines.
