/**
 * Per-turn telemetry: one JSON line per finished turn, appended best-effort to
 * `<stateDir>/telemetry.jsonl`. Reads tolerate corrupt lines; writes never throw
 * into the turn lifecycle (the caller wraps this, but we also swallow here as a
 * second line of defense). All fs access goes through an injectable `fsImpl` so
 * the behaviour is unit-testable without touching disk.
 *
 * Concurrency caveat: the size roll is a stat -> rename -> append sequence with
 * no locking, so it is racy under concurrent detached workers. Two processes can
 * both decide to roll and clobber each other's `.jsonl.1`, so at most one rolled
 * generation may be lost. This is an accepted tradeoff for best-effort telemetry;
 * the read side already tolerates torn/partial lines, so a lost generation only
 * costs old history, never correctness of the live file.
 *
 * Cross-file skew caveat (restart rate): the broker event log
 * (broker-telemetry.jsonl) and this per-turn file roll INDEPENDENTLY at the same
 * byte cap, and doctor --clean can roll one without the other. The broker-sourced
 * restart rate divides a broker-file numerator by a turn-file denominator, so the
 * two inputs can cover different time spans. aggregateTelemetry mitigates this by
 * WINDOWING the broker numerator to the surviving turn span (it only counts
 * broker events at/after the oldest surviving turn's startedAt) and CLAMPING the
 * displayed rate to 1.0. Events with no parseable timestamp cannot be proven
 * out-of-window and are kept, so the guard never silently under-reports churn.
